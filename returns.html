You can return items within 25 days of receipt of delivery in Your Orders. It can take up to 45 days for an item to reach us once you return it. After we receive the item at our fulfillment center, allow up to seven business days for the refund amount to show up in your account.

If your return postage exceeds the value of the automatic refund issued, you can contact our Customer Service Center to request a refund of the remaining postage cost. If you return a defective, damaged, or incorrect item, you'll be refunded the full postage cost, as well as your Import Fees Deposit, when your return is processed.
